## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The MVP for the Spoiler Blocker extension is a functional prototype (see video below) of the browser extension with the Keyword filtering feature designed. 
The basic text processing is used to detect and filter keywords by blurring, replacing or deleting keywords as specified by the user on all websites.

The demo video- "MVP extension" shows the working of the prototype.
